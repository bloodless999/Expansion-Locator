# Expansion for PlaceholderAPI ➼ **LOCATOR**

✦ Locator is great for RolePlay/Political servers and etc.

❃ With this expansion you can easily display your **«country, region, city, currency, currency name»**. 
And it's all in one expansion!

### Optimization
❂ This expansion is __**optimized**__ and does not parse the ip data every time, 
but it is enough to parse it once, and the data will be saved in memory ⟨ until the server is restarted ⟩.
